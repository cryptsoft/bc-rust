//! This page documents advanced features of the Module Lattice Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA)
//! available in this crate.
//!
//!
//! # Streaming APIs
//!
//! Sometimes the message you need to sign or verify is too big to fit in device memory all at once.
//! No worries, we got you covered!
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::traits::Signature;
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // Let's pretend this message was so long that you couldn't possibly
//! // stream the whole thing over a network, and you need it pre-hashed.
//! let msg_chunk1 = b"The quick brown fox ";
//! let msg_chunk2 = b"jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let mut signer = MLDSA65::sign_init(&sk, None).unwrap();
//! signer.sign_update(msg_chunk1);
//! signer.sign_update(msg_chunk2);
//! let sig: Vec<u8> = signer.sign_final().unwrap();
//! // This is the signature value that you can save to a file or whatever you need.
//!
//! // This is compatible with a verifies that takes the whole message as one chunk:
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
//! match MLDSA65::verify(&pk, msg, None, &sig) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//!
//! // But of course there's also a streaming API for the verifier!
//! let mut verifier = MLDSA65::verify_init(&pk, None).unwrap();
//! verifier.verify_update(msg_chunk1);
//! verifier.verify_update(msg_chunk2);
//!
//! match verifier.verify_final(&sig.as_slice()) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//!
//! Note that the streaming API also supports setting the signing context `ctx` and signing nonce `rnd`,
//! which are explained in more detail below.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::traits::Signature;
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // Let's pretend this message was so long that you couldn't possibly
//! // stream the whole thing over a network, and you need it pre-hashed.
//! let msg_chunk1 = b"The quick brown fox ";
//! let msg_chunk2 = b"jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let mut signer = MLDSA65::sign_init(&sk, Some(b"signing ctx value")).unwrap();
//! signer.set_signer_rnd([0u8; 32]); // an all-zero rnd is the "deterministic" mode of ML-DSA
//! signer.sign_update(msg_chunk1);
//! signer.sign_update(msg_chunk2);
//! let sig: Vec<u8> = signer.sign_final().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # External Mu mode
//!
//! Here, `mu` refers to the message digest which is computed internally to the ML-DSA algorithm:
//!
//! > 𝜇 ← H(BytesToBits(𝑡𝑟)||𝑀′, 64)
//! >   ▷ message representative that may optionally be computed in a different cryptographic module
//!
//! The External Mu mode of ML-DSA fulfills a similar function to [hash_mldsa] in that it allows large
//! messages to be pre-digested outside of the cryptographic module that holds the private key,
//! but it does it in a way that is compatible with the ML-DSA verification function.
//! In other works, whereas [hash_mldsa] represents a different signature algorithm, the external mu
//! mode of ML-DSA is simply internal implementation detail of how the signature was computed and
//! produces signatures that are indistinguishable from "direct" ML-DSA mode.
//!
//! The one potential complication with external mu mode -- that [hash_mldsa] does not have --
//! is that it requires you to know the public key that you are about to sign the message with.
//! Or, more specifically, the hash of the public key `tr`.
//! `tr` is a public value (derivable from the public key), so there is no harm in, for example,
//! sending it down to a client device so that it can pre-hash a large message and only send the
//! 64-byte `mu` value up to the server to be signed.
//! But in some contexts, the message has to be pre-hashed for performance reasons but
//! the public key that will be used for signing cannot be known in advance.
//! For those use cases, your only choice is to use [hash_mldsa].
//!
//! This library exposes [MuBuilder] which can be used to pre-hash a large to-be-signed message
//! along with the public key hash `tr`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::traits::Signature;
//!
//! let (pk, _) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // Let's pretend this message was so long that you couldn't possibly
//! // stream the whole thing over a network, and you need it pre-hashed.
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let mu: [u8; 64] = MuBuilder::compute_mu(msg, None, &pk.compute_tr()).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! Note: if you are going to bind a `ctx` value (explained below), then you need to do in in [MuBuilder::compute_mu].
//!
//! If the message really is so huge that you can't hold it all in memory at once, then you might prefer a streaming API for
//! computing mu:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::traits::Signature;
//!
//! let (pk, _) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // Let's pretend this message was so long that you couldn't possibly
//! // stream the whole thing over a network, and you need it pre-hashed.
//! let msg_chunk1 = b"The quick brown fox ";
//! let msg_chunk2 = b"jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let mut mb = MuBuilder::do_init(&pk.compute_tr(), None).unwrap();
//! mb.do_update(msg_chunk1);
//! mb.do_update(msg_chunk2);
//! let mu = mb.do_final();
//! ```
//!
//! Given a mu value, you can compute a signature that verifies as normal (no mu's required!):
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::traits::Signature;
//!
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // Assume this was computed somewhere else and sent to you.
//! // They would have had to know pk!
//! let mu: [u8; 64] = MuBuilder::compute_mu(msg, None, &pk.compute_tr()).unwrap();
//!
//! let sig = MLDSA65::sign_mu(&sk, &mu).unwrap();
//! // This is the signature value that you can save to a file or whatever you need.
//!
//! match MLDSA65::verify(&pk, msg, None, &sig) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//!
//! ```
//!
//! # Ctx and Rnd params
//! Various functions in this crate let you set the signing context value (`ctx`) and the signing nonce (`rnd`).
//! Let's talk about them both:
//!
//! ## ctx
//! The `ctx` value allows the signer to bind the signature value to an extra piece of information
//! (up to 255 bytes long) that must also be known to the verifier in order to successfully verify the signature.
//! This optional parameter allows cryptographic protocol designers to get additional binding properties
//! from the ML-DSA signature.
//! The `ctx` value should be something that is known to both the signer and verifier,
//! does not necessarily need to be a secret, but should not go over the wire as part of the not-yet-verified message.
//! Examples of uses of the `ctx` could include binding the application data type (ex: `FooEmailData`) in order
//! to disambiguate other data types that share an encoding (ex: `FooTextDocumentData`) and might otherwise be possible for an
//! attacker to trick a verifier into accepting one in place of the other.
//! In a network protocol, `ctx` could be used to bind a transaction ID or protocol nonce in order to strongly
//! protect against replay attacks.
//! Generally, `ctx` is one of those things that if you don't know what it does, then you're probably
//! fine to ignore it.
//!
//! Example of signing and verifying with a `ctx` value:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait};
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::traits::Signature;
//!
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox";
//! let ctx = b"FooTextDocumentFormat";
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! let sig: Vec<u8> = MLDSA65::sign(&sk, msg, Some(ctx)).unwrap();
//! // This is the signature value that you can save to a file or whatever you need.
//!
//! match MLDSA65::verify(&pk, msg, Some(ctx), &sig) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## rnd
//!
//! This is the signature nonce, whose purpose is to ensure that you get different signature values
//! if you sign the same message with the same public key multiple times.
//!
//! In general, the "deterministic" mode of ML-DSA (which usually uses an all-zero `rnd`) is considered
//! secure and safe to use but you may lose certain privacy properties, because, for example,
//! it becomes obvious that multiple identical signatures means that the same message was signed multiple times
//! by the same private key.
//!
//! The default mode of ML-DSA uses a `rnd` generated by the library's OS-backed RNG, but you can set the `rnd`
//! if you need to; for example if you are running on an embedded device that does not have access to an RNG.
//!
//! Note that in order to avoid combinatorial explosion of API functions, setting the `rnd` value is only
//! available in conjunction with external mu or streaming modes. The example of setting `rnd` on the streaming
//! API was shown above.
//!
//! Here is an example of using the [MLDSA::sign_mu_deterministic] function:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa::{MLDSA65, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::traits::Signature;
//!
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let (pk, sk) = MLDSA65::keygen().unwrap();
//!
//! // Assume this was computed somewhere else and sent to you.
//! // They would have had to know pk!
//! let mu: [u8; 64] = MuBuilder::compute_mu(msg, None, &pk.compute_tr()).unwrap();
//!
//! // Typically, "deterministic" mode of ML-DSA will use an all-zero rnd,
//! // but we've exposed it so you can set any value you need to.
//! let sig = MLDSA65::sign_mu_deterministic(&sk, &mu, [0u8; 32]).unwrap();
//! // This is the signature value that you can save to a file or whatever you need.
//!
//! match MLDSA65::verify(&pk, msg, None, &sig) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # sign_from_seed
//!
//! This mode is intended for users with extreme performance or resource-limitation requirements.
//!
//! A very careful analysis of the ML-DSA signing algorithm will show that you don't actually need
//! the entire ML-DSA private key to be in memory at the same time. In fact, it is possible to merge
//! the keygen() and sign() functions
//!
//! We provide [MLDSA::sign_mu_deterministic_from_seed] which implements such an algorithm.
//! It has a significantly lower peak-memory-footprint than the regular signing API (although there's
//! always room for more optimization), and according to our benchmarks it is only around 25% slower
//! than signing with a fully-expanded private key -- which is still faster than performing a full
//! keygen followed by a regular sign since there are intermediate values common to keygen and sign
//! that the merged function is able to only compute once.
//!
//! Since this is intended for hard-core embedded systems people, we have not wrapped this in all
//! the beginner-friendly APIs. If you need this, then we assume you know what you're doing!
//!
//! Example usage:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::errors::SignatureError;
//! use bouncycastle_mldsa::{MLDSA44, MLDSA44_SIG_LEN, MLDSATrait, MLDSAPublicKeyTrait, MuBuilder};
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::traits::Signature;
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::traits::KeyMaterial;
//! use bouncycastle_core_interface::key_material::{KeyMaterial256, KeyType};
//!
//! let msg = b"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog";
//!
//! let seed = KeyMaterial256::from_bytes_as_type(
//!     &hex::decode("000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f").unwrap(),
//!     KeyType::Seed,
//! ).unwrap();
//!
//! // At some point, you'll need to compute the public key, both to get `tr`, and so other
//! // people can verify your signature.
//! // There's no possible short-cut to efficiently computing the public key or `tr` from the seed;
//! // you have to run the full keygen to get the full private key, at least momentarily, then
//! // you can discard it in only keep `tr` and `seed`.
//! let (pk, _) = MLDSA44::keygen_from_seed(&seed).unwrap();
//! let tr: [u8; 64] = pk.compute_tr();
//!
//! // Assume this was computed somewhere else and sent to you.
//! // They would have had to know pk!
//! let mu: [u8; 64] = MuBuilder::compute_mu(msg, None, &tr).unwrap();
//! let rnd: [u8; 32] = [0u8; 32]; // with this API, you're responsible for your own nonce
//!                                // because in the cases where this level of memory optimization
//!                                // is needed, our RNG probably won't work anyway.
//!
//! let mut sig = [0u8; MLDSA44_SIG_LEN];
//! let bytes_written = MLDSA44::sign_mu_deterministic_from_seed_out(&seed, &mu, rnd, &mut sig).unwrap();
//!
//! // it can be verified normally
//! match MLDSA44::verify(&pk, msg, None, &sig) {
//!     Ok(()) => println!("Signature is valid!"),
//!     Err(SignatureError::SignatureVerificationFailed) => println!("Signature is invalid!"),
//!     Err(e) => panic!("Something else went wrong: {:?}", e),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! While this is currently only supported when operating from a seed-based private key, something analogous
//! could be done that merges the sk_decode() and sign() routines when working with the standardized
//! private key encoding (which is often called the "semi-expanded format" since the in-memory representation
//! is still larger).
//! Contact us if you need such a thing implemented.
